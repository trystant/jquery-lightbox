NOTE: The original library link no longer seems to be working. This might be an abandoned fork.

This is a fork of the JQuery lightbox plugin, developed by [Leandro Vieira Pinho] (http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox) . I have made a couple of modifications to it so far, including:


1. Make the top property a configurable option.
2. Add callback hooks for opening and closing the lightbox; now you can put arbitrary functions in the setup options and have them run successfully.

TODOS: 

1. Put together testing procedure.
2. Figure out minimizing process.
